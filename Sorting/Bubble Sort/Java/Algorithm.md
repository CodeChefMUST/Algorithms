# Bubble Sort Algorithm
**Bubble sorting** Bubble sort is a simple algorithm that compares the first element of the array to the next one. If the current element of the array is numerically greater than the next one, the elements are swapped. Likewise, the algorithm will traverse the entire element of the array.

**Obejective:**
To sort the elements of the array in ascending order.

**For Example:**
The array that we need to sort (-1,7,-32,0,89)

**Expected result:** (-32, -1, 0, 7, 89)

**Bubble Sort Applications**

Bubble sort is used if

->complexity does not matter
->short and simple code is preferred

**Time Complexity:**
Best case time complexity is O(n).
