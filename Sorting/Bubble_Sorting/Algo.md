# Bubble Sort Algorithm
**Bubble sorting** is a sorting algorithm that compares two  elements which are next to each other and swaps them until they are in the planned order . 
We're going to compare executive items if they are out of place then we will swap them, the highest number will bubble it's way to the right with each iteration, a sorted partition will form at the end of array.
