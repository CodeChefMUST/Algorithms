Heap sort is one of the sorting algorithms used to arrange a list of elements in order. Heapsort algorithm uses one of the tree concepts called Heap Tree. In this sorting algorithm, we use Max Heap to arrange list of elements in Descending order and Min Heap to arrange list elements in Ascending order.


•	Step 1 - Make a Binary Tree with given list of Elements.

•	Step 2 - Convert the Binary Tree into Min Heap.

•	Step 3 - Delete the root element from Min Heap using Heapify method.

•	Step 4 - Put the deleted element into the Sorted list.

•	Step 5 - Repeat the same until Min Heap becomes empty.

•	Step 6 - Display the sorted list.

Complexity of the Heap Sort Algorithm
To sort an unsorted list with 'n' number of elements, following are the complexities:

Worst Case: O(n log n)

Best Case : O(n log n)
