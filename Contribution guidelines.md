# Contribution Guidelines

### **Steps**

1. Browse code and issue list, find some existing issue or create a new one.
2. Comment on the issue that you want to work on. Don't forget to mention the language you are planning to use.
3. Wait for issue to be assigned to you.
4. Create a new branch in your forked repo and start working on your code.
5. Along with the code add following contents -

* Relevant comments for easier understanding
* A block comment with
    * Sample Inputs
    * Sample Outputs
    * Time Complexity
    * Space Complexity
* You need not write any `main` function
* Don't forget to mention your username as the author
* Make sure to name your files according to these guidelines:
    * Name your file in camel case. For example, if your contribution involves the source code for binary search in c++, then your file name must be BinarySearch.cpp. The same way, LinearSearch.py or BubbleSort.java.
    * Pay close attention to the file structure, and if new folders are required to be created by you, then make sure that the spellings are correct and the naming convention follows camel case if required. For creating a new folder, every word must start with a capitalized letter. 

6. Update algo.md file in present in the language folder for every algorithm, if required.
7. Create a pull request and mention the issue number, also, give edit access to collaborators and maintainers.
8. Wait for it to be get reviewed and approved by maintainers.

### **Note**

* Issues will be assigned on a first come, first serve basis. The person who creates the issue gets the first priority. And then, issues are assigned based on who commented first. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned and the programming language you are going to use, and it will be done if found fit.
* You cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
* If you have anything else in mind, **FEEL FREE TO CREATE AN ISSUE** and please wait for it to be assigned to you. If assigned to you, then you can start working on it and create a PR.
* All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and then create a PR.
* In your code file, add (Inside a multiline comment) Sample Input and Output at the end of the file along with Time and Space Complexity.
* Every time you add a file via a Pull Request also update the algo.md file for that particular language in the same PR. You'll find a algo.md file in each language folder for every algorithm.
* Plagiarism is highly discouraged and a plagiarized PR won't be accepted at all and will be marked as spam.
* PR should be created within a week of you being assigned to it.
* At no point of time, you can claim more than 4 issues i.e. you can have at max 4 working issues, for this repository.
