# Graph Depth-first search (DFS)

## Definition
```
"Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing
or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm
starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as
the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far
as possible along each branch before backtracking."

## Example

![Simple DFS](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Depth-First-Search.gif)

This first example shows the DFS in a ~~tree~~ uni-direcional graph.

![Complex DFS](https://codeforces.com/predownloaded/8d/be/8dbe5d89e58b67f3d8e4d8e0e8eb3358ba921b28.png)

This second example shows the DFS in a (actual) bidirectional graph. The white circles are the not visited nodes, the gray circles are the visited node and the red circle is the actual node.
